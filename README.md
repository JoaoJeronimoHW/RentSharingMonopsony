Abstract:
This paper investigates how cyclical fluctuations in productivity shape the division of rents between firms and workers in imperfect labor markets, with a particular focus on the interaction between monopsony power and binding wage floors. Extending the structural framework of Chan et al. (2024), we develop a dynamic model in which firms face upward-sloping labor supply and heterogeneous, industry-level wage floors-reflecting collective bargaining or minimum wage policies-that can bind asymmetrically across sectors. The model predicts that rent-sharing elasticities are cyclically sensitive: sector-wide productivity shocks are more strongly passed through to wages than firm-specific shocks, especially in industries where wage floors are binding. In these settings, positive productivity shocks increase profits without commensurate wage or employment gains, while negative shocks are absorbed through employment reductions rather than wage cuts, generating asymmetric wage adjustment. We empirically test these predictions using matched employer-employee data from Portugal, finding that rent-sharing is indeed more pronounced for sector-level shocks and that binding wage floors dampen wage flexibility while amplifying employment volatility. These results challenge the conventional view that productivity gains are broadly shared with workers and help explain phenomena such as “jobless growth” and stalled development in regulated labor markets.
